I am an ambitious and enthusiastic full stack junior developer. Since April 2017 I have been at Makers Academy, a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp, while there I have built the foundation for a career in software development. My time at Makers Academy has given me important characteristics to base my future development around including best practices, writing clean, readable code and the ability to quickly pick up new skills. I am looking to further my programming knowledge in a job role which will provide with support for my development in a challenging, exciting future in the tech industry.
 
 Skills
 Dedicated - I have always been a hard working and dedicated individual in any job role I have undertaken. Now as I look to change career I 
 am showing a heightened sense of dedication within full time education and looking for a successful new career path for the future.
 Inquisitive - Having an inquisitive nature has always brought great enjoyment when harvesting new knowledge. I have found coding to be a new
 and exciting challenge that I am by curious to continue in and look forward to working in a new career which will provide daily mental challenges.
 Team player- In past employment I have always enjoyed working within, and managing a team. Perspective from both sides gives an insight into
 the various roles and how to get the best from myself and others while working together. Teamwork has helped me hone communication skills in
 order to work well together.
 Adaptable - Whilst working, I have been able to step up to challenges I have been presented with, whether it is taking on new
 job roles and the tasks involved, solving problems or following in a new vastly different career.
